1. Traveling Salesman Problem
  - Problem statement: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" 

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Problem statement: Find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, find the shortest path from a node (called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

3. A* Search
  - Problem statement: Find the shortest path between nodes for a given occupancy grid.
